The NoteWidget code we just created is a React component that represents the Notes widget within the planner app. 
It provides the necessary functionality to create, edit, and organize notes.

The NoteWidget component is designed to be reusable, allowing multiple instances of the widget to be used throughout the app. 
It utilizes state management with the useState hook to handle the note data and track any changes made by the user.

The component renders a user interface that includes an input field for the note title and a textarea for the note content. 
It also provides buttons for saving the note, editing existing notes, and deleting notes.

The saveNote function is responsible for updating the note data and either creating a new note or updating an existing one based on the state of the component. 
It communicates with the parent component (App.js) through props to add or update the note within the overall notes collection.

The NoteWidget component allows users to create and manage their notes seamlessly within the planner app. 
It provides a clean and intuitive interface for note-taking, contributing to better organization and productivity.
